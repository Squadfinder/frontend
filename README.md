# SquadFinder

## Introduction
  Welcome to SquadFinder! This is an app made for video gamers who want to join up with other gamers to play the games that they love. Upon starting up the app, the user is prompted to log in to a profile.  Once selected, the user can view their personalized list of video games, start a search for new video games to add to their collection, and invite other gamers to a 'Squad' event. Once a Squad has been created, it will appear in the users' 'My Squads' section, where they can view all of their upcoming Squads, who has been invited to each Squad, and the date and time of each event.  Our application gets all of our data from our back-end API, which sources the video game data from RAWG API. RAWG is a video game database that has over 800,000 video games, so our users will be able to find whatever games they like to play, on whichever platform they prefer.
  
  This application is our team's final Capstone Project for Turing School of Software and Design, and was built in 2 weeks by a 7 person team made up of 3 front-end students and 4 back end-students. This is the repo for the front-end team, and [this](https://github.com/Squadfinder/backend-ruby) is a link to the back-end repo.

## Application in Action


## Technologies
  - React Native
  - Jest Native
  - React Native Testing Library
  - Expo
  - VSCode
  - CircleCI

## Goals, Challenges, and Wins
### Goals
 - Learn and implement the use of React Native.

### Challenges
 - Since React Native mainly targets mobile platforms like Android and iOS, we did not have access to the traditional Dev Tools we would have used when developing a web-based application.

### Wins


## Possible Future Extensions
  - We would like to add in authenitcation to the login screen so that users can use a password to log in to their profile, and each user would have a truly unique and customizeable accout for the app.
  - In addition to the password protected profiles, we would add a profile creation form so that new users would be able to set up an account and a profile, and existing users could edit their information such as 'Gamertag'/name and their preferred gaming platform.
